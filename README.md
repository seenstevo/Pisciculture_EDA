# Exploration of Pisciculture - History and Future

## Introduction to Project

Using historical fish production data from all countries (capture and pisciculture) I have explored how the increase in production has evolved over time. The analysis has focused on regional differences in this evolution over time and on what factors have been important for the growth of the pisciculture. A major focus has been on the potential for the pisciculture to feed a growing African population where pisciculture is largely nascent and could be primed to grow. 

## Main points from project and 

- Globally, pisciculture has caught up with production from capture.
- Global production from capture effectively peaked in the 90's.
- Global growth in consumption of fish largely driven by Asia.
- What factors might influence in the growth of freshwater pisciculture?
- Can we create an index of opportunity for future growth of the sector?
- Which sub-saharan african countries could be well positioned to grow the freshwater pisciculture sector?
